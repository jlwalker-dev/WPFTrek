# WPFTrek
I wrote an updated version of the original Star Trek game in Java to help myself and other non-Java speakers learn 
a little bit about the languange.  Once that was completed, I decided to do the same for newbies in C#.  While I've
done a number of projects in C#, this was actually a learning experience as I've never needed to do extensive 
sharing of objects between threads.  My projects for work have always used encapsulated thread instances that do 
not share resources.  It was very straight forward in basic Java, but C# offers a bit more flexibility and thus
requires a bit more work.

I also enhanced the program a bit from the Java version and if I do enhance the game any further, I'll do it to the
C# version first.

This code is released into the wild without restrictions.  I just ask that you give credit in the comments where it's due.
